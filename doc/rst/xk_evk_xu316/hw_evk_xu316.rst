    `xcore.ai` Evaluation Kit

The XK-EVK-XU316  allows testing in multiple application scenarios and provides a good general software development
board for simple tests and demos. The XK-EVK-XU316 comprises an `xcore.ai` processor with a set of I/O devices and
connectors arranged around it, as shown in :numref:`hw_evk_xu316_block_diagram`.

External hardware features board include, four general purpose LEDs, two general purpose push-button switches,
a PDM microphone connector, audio codec with line-in and line-out jack, QSPI flash memory, LPDDR1 external memory
58 GPIO connections from tile 0 and 1, micro USB for power and host connection, MIPI connector for a MIPI camera,
integrated `xTAG` debug adapter and a reset switch with LED to indicate running.

.. warning::

    The `xcore.ai Evaluation Kit` is a general purpose evaluation platform and should be considered
    an "example" rather than a fully fledged reference design.

Analogue Audio Input & Output
-----------------------------

A stereo CODEC (TLV320AIC3204), connected to the xcore.ai device via an I²S interface, provides analogue input/output
functionality at line level.

The audio CODEC is are configured by the `xcore.ai` device via an I²C bus.

Audio Clocking
--------------

`xcore.ai` devices are equipped with a secondary (or `application`) PLL which is used to generate the audio clocks for the CODEC.

LEDs, Buttons and Other IO
--------------------------

Four green LED's and two push buttons are provided for general purpose user interfacing.

The LEDs are connected to PORT 4C and the buttons are connected to bits [0:1] of PORT 4D.

All spare I/O is brought out and made available on 0.1" headers for easy connection of expansion
boards etc.

Power
-----

The XK-EVK-XU316 requires a 5V power source that is normally provided through the micro-USB cable J3.
The voltage is converted by on-board regulators to the 0V9, 1V8 and 3V3 supplies used by the components.

The board should therefore be configured to present itself as a bus powered device when connected to an
active USB host.

Debug
-----

For convenience the board includes an on-board xTAG4 for debugging via JTAG/xSCOPE.
This is accessed via the USB (micro-B) receptacle marked ``DEBUG``.
